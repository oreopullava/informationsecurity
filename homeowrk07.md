<h1>a) installing TOR browser</h1>

I downloaded this in the class. But the steps were quite quick to do
1. I went to TOR browser download page
2. downloaded the .tar.xz file
3. used the command line to unzip the file
4. navigated to the directory
5. then used start-tor-browser.desktop

We used "ahmia" in the class so I decided to use that too as an example

<h4>Marketplace</h4>

I just decided to lookup with "store" and opened the first result. I got into this techonology shop. The prices were very low compared to the real prices. The stores name is "Tembow Global Services"

Everything you want to buy from the site you need to use crypto. There were three choices Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT ERC20.
