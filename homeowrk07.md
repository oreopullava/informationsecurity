<h4>Chapter 2. The Tor Browser</h4>

<h6>Intro</h6>
- browser that is modified from fireofox
  <br>

- hides IP address
    <br>
- anyone can use

<h6>History and Intended Use of The Onion Router</h6>
- allow anonymous communication
  <br>
- allows to connect to websites that may be blocked
  <br>
- can be also used for crimes...
  <br>
- developed by US government, but not controlled by them presently
  <br>
- US governemnent is researching methods to deanonymize users of it

<h6>How the onion router works</h6>
- directs the route of a user’s Internet traffic through random relays on the Internet
  <br>
- data first layered with ellptic curve crpythography
  <br>
-  Tor routes a user’s internet traffic through random relays on the internet, making it difficult to trace
  <br>
-  As the encrypted data passes through each relay (entry, middle, exit), a layer of encryption is stripped away until it reaches the final destination.
  <br>
- The exit relay connects to the user’s target with an unencrypted connection but does not know the full route of the traffic
  <br>
-  Tor changes the entry, middle, and exit relays every 10 minutes, further enhancing anonymity and making tracking nearly impossible

<h6>Tracking criminals using tor</h6>
- government agencies working on deanonymizing to find criminals/terrorists
  <br>
- but found ones are more based on the errors of suspects
  <br>
- not having federal resources to investigate if alone

2. downloaded the .tar.xz file
3. used the command line to unzip the file

5. then used start-tor-browser.desktop

<h4>Marketplace</h4>

I just decided to lookup with "store" and opened the first result. I got into this techonology shop. The prices were very low compared to the real prices. The stores name is "Tembow Global Services"

Everything you want to buy from the site you need to use crypto. There were three choices Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT ERC20.
