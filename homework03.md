<h3> [D24] I Was Almost a Cybercriminal - Sergey Ichtchenko </h3>

<h5>Intro</h5>
- Testausserveri is organization that wants to give a community to ethical hacking
- Most of the reasons that got people into programming/hacking were family, curiosity or gaming
- Stereotype for coders are "nerdy" or people who don't go out or don't have friends, when in reality they can look like anything

<h5>Why do some young people misbehave online or commit cybercrime?</h5>
- Pressure of other people -> bad influence
- Honour among criminals
- it's forbidden so it's more fun...
- Bullying
- Getting free stuff from it

<h5> Personal Story </h5>
- Found vulnerability on linnanmäki app where you could get your pass with code
- with very simple change to JS code got a free ticket basically
- Reported the vulnerability to Linnanmäki
- Got thanked by company and rewarded
- The issue got fixed

<h5> Interventions </h5>
- If there isn't good feedback or rewards for helping it can lead to cybercriminality
- Parents need to see their childs unique skill, but it needs to be legal
- A lot of learning resources for hacking like youtube, tryhackme and hakatemia.fi

631/tcp ipp = is used for the Internet Printing Protocol, network printing protocol that allows clients to communicate with printers over the internet or a local network.

As a new one we got port 80, that is the default port used by the HTTP protocol for web traffic. So before installing the web server it was closed because no server was listening to it.
