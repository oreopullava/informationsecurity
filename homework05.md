- message = plaintext
- hiding plaintext = encryption (encipher)
- encrypted message = ciphertext
- ciphertext -> plaintext = decryption (decipher)


<h1>Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg</h1>
https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/

- Encryption prevents anyone from reading
- Signing protects message from modification
- Public keys helps you to have trust without meeting

- PGP is highly secure standard for encryption
- By changing keys they establish trust between parties
- creating keypair by "$ gpg --gen-key"
- for sending a message to another person youu need to have their public key
- export, import, verify, trust
- decryption happens with secret key

It also keeps you safe from attacks like phishing, password reuse, brute force attacks, keylogging and preventing credential stuffing. Password manager stores all your passwords in encrypted database.
